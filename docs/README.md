# About this project

## Welcome to Plutus Community Documentation site

This documentation site is built from the contributions of current Plutus Pioneer students and alumni. Our goal is to help future Plutus developers to stand on the shoulder of giants by provding a resource which combines the lessons and experiences from previous cohorts.

Please don't expect that everything will work out of the box as the Plutus ecosystem evolves quickly. All the content is created from the best efforts and knowledge of volunteers. Don't hesitate to join us if you have something to share with others.

This website has been a valuable source of information for past cohorts, mainly because:

-   Plutus development has evolved since the first cohort and will likely keep evolving
-   official documentation is often out of date or fragmented
-   new comers are introducted to new tools and techniques
-   the environment setup instructions may vastly differ between platforms
-   setting up an environment for Plutus development can be challenging

## How to collaborate

Any collaboration is welcome, it doesn't need to be a new document, corrections to the old ones are much needed. To do so, just modify or create a document in the corresponding directory inside "docs", and make a pull request using the community repository:

<https://github.com/plutus-community/docs/>

In the case of contributing a fix, please make sure to include a description of the issue fixed to facilitate the task of the moderator. Once it is approved, it'll be automatically published and linked into the ToC of the site (for now, using readthedocs.io service thru mkdocs).

## Style Guide

At the momment we are using Markdown language for the documentation for its simplicity, broad adoption and syntax support within the Github web-based editor. Additionally, we're using Github for version and access control so the combination works seamlessly well together. More information on Markdown can be found here:

<https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax>

To help standarize the content, we recommend to write the articles following the schema below:

-   Title: using #, must be short and descriptive, including OS and technology when applicable. Beware that this string will be used by mkdocs to generate the navigation menu, so try to be as specific as possible.
-   Author, contact, date of creation, date of last revision.
-   Brief description.
-   Sections (##) Subsections (###) and content: as a general rule, avoid using pictures unless it is strictly necessary. If you do, upload it to the "img" directory, and name it using snake_case_format_XX.ext using the title of the article for easy identification. Use much plain text as possible, it is the preferred option as it can be copied, pasted, and searched internally and externally to the site. Make use of \``` \``` for marking code snippets.
-   Changelog (optional): Brief summary of changes over time.
-   Link to a dedicated forum thread (optional) : Link to a new post on Cardano's forum announcing the new article, that can be used to interact with other users, overcoming this way the static nature of the documentation site.
